# Elon Companies Interactive Website
🤓 I created this website in 2021 as part of a school project.  \
🎯 Chose to talk about the most interesting companies Elon Musk owns and/or is/was involved in (rip OpenAI).  \
✅ Prereq to understanding the content is a decent level in French ... or access to Google Translate. Planning on correcting the many grammatical errors. \
⏳ This took me about 40-50 hours and needed to include certain elements (slideshow, date/hour of display, multiple pages), but I enjoyed building it and tried incorporating fun features. \
👀 Feel free to take a look at it, and pay attention to the progression bars and other small details!\
